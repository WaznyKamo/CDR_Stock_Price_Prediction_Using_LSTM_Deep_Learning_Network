# CDR_Stock_Price_Prediction_Using_LSTM_Deep_Learning_Network

A prediction of stock prices using neural network. Data for training comes from a single company and the results are very close to naive prediction. 

Features of the neural network are:
* Opening price
* Closing price
* Highest price of the day
* Lowest price of the day
* Volume

Considering small amount of training data and simple input features, the results are better than expected.
